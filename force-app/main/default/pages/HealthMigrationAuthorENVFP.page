I understand that I have the right to cancel the New Policy(ies) by giving a written notice to Cigna General, provided that no claim has been made under the New Policy(ies). I understand that to exercise this right, the notice of cancellation must be signed by me and received directly by Cigna General within the cooling-off period at 16/F, 348 Kwun Tong Road, Hong Kong or by email at <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue"></span>enquiryhk@cigna.com. I understand that the cooling-off period is the period of thirty (30) calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of the New Policy(ies) or the cooling-off notice to me or my nominated representative (whichever is the earlier). I understand that the cooling-off notice is a notice that will be sent to me or my nominated representative by Cigna General to notify me of the cooling-off period around the time the New Policy(ies) is(are) delivered. If I so request, the New Policy(ies) will be cancelled with effect from the Effective Date as if it(they) has(have) not been issued, and my Pre-transfer Policy(ies) with Cigna Life will deem to be continued and not terminated from the Effective Date.

I agree that Cigna General may apply such refund towards the premium levy payable in respect of the New Policy(ies) for the remaining period of the same year or month (as the case may be) ("GI Levy").
